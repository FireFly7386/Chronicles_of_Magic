# Chronicles_of_Magic

## Description

My game for GitHub GameOff 2023

## Story

You are a wizard and your Kingdom was invaded by monsters - so you have to free it. To do that you must *__scale__* your library to get more places for spell books and learn 'em.

## TODO

### Core functionality

- [ ] Multiple Levels
- [ ] From Levels you beat you recapture a spell book or parts for you library
- [ ] __Good sounds__
- [ ] Health/Mana System
- [ ] Exp Level System
- [ ] Different Spells
- [ ] Find Backgrounds for Menus
- [ ] Make Level Icons
- [ ] Level Names

### Nice to Have features

- [ ] Different Elements to choose from when you begin to play
- [ ] Something like the monsters invading your Kingdom when you first start the game
- [ ] Animation when clicking Play

### Ideas if I continue after Jam

- [ ] Multiplayer
